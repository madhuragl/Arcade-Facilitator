If you've redeemed your pass, I'd encourage you to start doing skill badges from here: https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/arcade-facilitator/syllabus

As from 22nd July-31st July, 

1 skill badge = 1 arcade point
After 31st July

2 skill badge = 1 arcade point

So this is the best time to earn more arcade points and earn more goodies!
